                <p class="service-description indented"> I developed a centralized healthcare management database to
                    streamline data storage, retrieval, and sharing, improving patient care quality. Designed in third
                    normal form (3NF), the database minimizes redundancy, ensures integrity, and simplifies maintenance,
                    enabling efficient access to up-to-date patient records across departments. I integrated phpMyAdmin
                    and Power BI for advanced data analytics, allowing healthcare professionals to track patient
                    demographics, monitor health outcomes, and optimize resource allocation. Interactive dashboards in
                    Power BI present complex data in a visual format, supporting informed decision-making. Additionally,
                    I created a front-end website using HTML and PHP, providing a user-friendly interface for accessing
                    the database. This ensures secure and efficient management of patient records while supporting
                    scalability and regulatory compliance. This solution combines database optimization, data insights,
                    and a front-end to enhance healthcare delivery and organizational management.

                    class="service-link2">Github Repository</a>
                <p class="service-description indented">I implemented automation and monitoring solutions using Ansible,
                    Prometheus, and Grafana to streamline IT system management and enhance system observability. I began
                    by configuring Ansible for automated deployments across multiple virtual machines, creating secure
                    user accounts, establishing SSH key-based authentication, and structuring playbooks to efficiently
                    manage server inventories and automate file operations. Building on this automation framework, I
                    deployed Prometheus to monitor system performance by setting up node exporters and configuring
                    secure system users. Using tools like promtool, I verified configurations and ensured accurate data
                    collection accessible via a web interface. To visualize system metrics, I created a customized
                    Grafana dashboard displaying key performance indicators such as disk space, memory usage, CPU load,
                    network traffic, power status, and system uptime. This project demonstrated my ability to automate
                    IT operations, maintain secure environments, and deploy scalable monitoring and visualization
                    solutions for effective system management.</p>

                <p class="service-description indented">Using GDevelop, I developed an engaging 8-bit rogue-lite game
                    that combined retro aesthetics with modern gameplay mechanics. This project involved designing
                    dynamic game levels and crafting immersive character experiences, while implementing responsive game
                    logic through event-based programming. I integrated AI programming for enemy behaviors and
                    fine-tuned gameplay optimization to ensure smooth performance. Through this hands-on experience, I
                    strengthened my skills in game design, problem-solving, and efficient resource management,
                    culminating in a fully functional and visually appealing rogue-lite adventure.</p>
