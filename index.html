                    Healthcare centers typically consist of various departments, each managing its own record-keeping system. This approach often results in challenges such as inefficient data sharing, inconsistencies in data, and a high burden of program maintenance. To address these issues, I have developed a centralized database for the healthcare management system. This solution facilitates more efficient storage, retrieval, and sharing of patient healthcare information, ultimately enhancing the quality of patient care. Notably, the database is designed in the third normal form (3NF), which minimizes redundancy, ensures data integrity, and simplifies querying and maintenance tasks. By standardizing data management, healthcare professionals can access accurate patient records across departments, improving coordination and decision-making.
                    In addition to database optimization, my project focuses on utilizing data analytics to improve healthcare management. Through the integration of software like phpMyAdmin and Power BI, I aim to deliver actionable insights from the data. These insights can help identify trends in patient demographics, monitor health outcomes, and optimize resource allocation. This data-driven approach is crucial for enhancing patient care, minimizing operational inefficiencies, and ensuring long-term sustainability in healthcare facilities.
                    Furthermore, the implementation of this centralized system supports better compliance with healthcare regulations and allows for scalability, accommodating future growth or changes in healthcare service delivery. The use of interactive dashboards in Power BI makes complex data more accessible, empowering healthcare administrators to make informed, timely decisions that directly impact patient outcomes and organizational efficiency.
